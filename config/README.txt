These configuration files were merged between cmsfpix1 and the previous version used on mp72.
 
I copied over the directory from cmsfpix1 and replaced all lines and files which referred to particular ROCs, etc., to those for the Cornell test stand.

The directory structure is also cleaned up to remove obsolete and unused directories and files.
