           the newest DiagSystem tag (EASTER2009-1).

POS_2_9_5  Add preliminary code for HV-dependent ROC configuration.
           Compiles, but is otherwise untested.

POS_2_9_4  Many updates to database code, some bug fixes, some diagSystem
	   migration. Previous tag (2_9_3) was tested at P5. This
           tag has not been tested at P5.

POS_2_9_3_2 A few additional patches added on top of POS_2_9_3_2. Used
           for our first mid-week global run of 2009. 

POS_2_9_3_1 POS_2_9_3 with small but critical bug fixes. Used for FPix
           checkout in April 2009.

POS_2_9_3  Many minor updates. Choice of files versus DB now made by
           env var setting. Additions to PixelSupervisor GUI to show
           progress of calibrations and status messages. Cleanup of

POS_2_8_7  Smaller fixes with respect to POS_2_8_6. Iana calibration
           fixes for multiple TKFEC crates. Several calibration have
           multiple crate fixes. Disabled FED spying since it was
           leaking shared memory. FED mode and control registers
           are now read from the fed_params.dat file.

POS_2_8_6  Several fixes: AOHBias speedup and selection of 
           safer point against temperature variations. The
           control and mode register for the fed is now taken
           from the fed_params.dat file in physics mode.
           The run directory structure is now on the form
           Run_57000/Run_57341. Changes to DCU readout and
           histoviewer and pixelanalysis tools.

POS_2_8_5  Fixes to the PixelCaliBconfiguration to deal with
           multiple FEC crates. Fixes in AddressLevel calibration
           to be more robust against dual TBM where the UB
           levels are different.

POS_2_8_4  Trim the directory structure at the level of the 
           module or plaquette. Summary root tree for address
           levels and rocub. Fixes to initialize wait for reading DCU.
           Fixes for synchronizing the states when configuring
           with run control. Fixes to setting of fec debug.

POS_2_8_3  More fixes for Delay25 calibration. Wrong version
           of PixelTKFECDelay25Calibration.h in POS_2_8_2 tag.

POS_2_8_2  Fix to the Delay25 calibration code.

POS_2_8_1  Improvments to the delay 25 algorithm. Now gives up
           on a point if it is inefficient. Scans all TBMs and
           finds common point. Plots for all different types of
           commands. Updates to DCS code for power-on sequence.
           Fixes in PixelFEDInterface and PixelFEDSupervisor to
           avoid having the application hang a long time at the
           end of a job. Also fixes to avoid a crash on the second
           run in physics mode. Updates to PixelHistoViewer.
           Bug fixes in reading PixelNameTranslation.

POS_2_8_0  Many updates. New FED firmware for the delay setting.
           Updated analysis tools, histoviewer, debbie, histograms
           calibration algorithms.

POS_2_7_13 Updates to PixelFEDClockPhase calibration so that we
           pick a later sampling point for the slow ROCs. Updates
           to many histograms in the root output. Updates to 
           integrate the DiagSystem. Fix for buffered commands
           in the FEC so that we can use buffered commands during 
           configuration.

POS_2_7_12 Updates from CRUZET to write out file with configuration
           used in a given run. Include code to do a VcThr calibration.
           The PixelCalibConfiguration can now set DACs relative to the
           default. This will be used for trim bit determination, but 
           might have other uses. In the PixelConfigFile::get method
           we now cache the content of the configurations.txt file.
           Many improvements in the PixelCalibConfiguration:nextFECState
           to speed up execution. Also in 
           PixelDACSettings::generateConfiguration we now use the 
           buffered commands --- but is disabled as it seems not to work.

POS_2_7_11 Updated to root output for PixelFEDAOHGainCalibration.cc
           PixelFEDLinearityVsVsfCalibration.cc and
           PixelFEDVsfAndVHldDelCalibration.cc. Fixes so that 
           calibration triggers (CalSync+L1A) can be generated
           from the LTC. 

POS_2_7_10 In the TBM UB calibration now pick the lower crossing
           in the case of multiple crossing. Updates to histograming
           to prevent crashes when writing root file. Fix to path
           of html file from AddressLevels and Baseline. The delay25 is
           now using buffered commands. Other minor updates to plots.

POS_2_7_9 Smaller bugfixes to makefiles and some fixes the
          root file output and state machine.

POS_2_7_8 Updates to PixelFEDSupervisor/Makefile that were
          missing in the 2_7_7 tag.

POS_2_7_7 Include new Delay25 calibration from Jennifer.

POS_2_7_6 Many smaller fixes, including cleanup of FECInterface,
          updates to putting output in Run directory, fixes to 
          FEDInterface for reporting error when reading FIFO 1,
          and addition of configuration information for chainsaw
          logger. 
           

POS_2_7_5 Updates to the statemachine to introduce an configuring
          state. This allow us to configure FED and FEC in parallel
          and to use the 'power on' sequence. PixelCalibConfiguration
          now sets the right trimbits when disabling the pixels+ many 
          other small fixes.   

POS_2_7_4 Fix to linking of PixelTKFECSupervisor for standalone
          running. Can now do scans with non-uniform steps. And
          added histogram for addresslevel rms summary per channel. 

POS_2_7_3 First steps towards rootfile output for addresslevels
          and the threshold vs caldelay calibration. Addresslevel
          calibration has been cleaned up. Now can update the 
          configurations from the supervisor gui after calibration has
          completed. New AOH gain calibration from Steve.

POS_2_7_2 Fixes problems in the statemachine implementation that
          caused crashes when halting. Bring in some development
          from Steve on calibrations.

POS_2_7_1 Same as 2_6_7 + FEDInterface changes to support 
          FEB 12 firmeware version. (Tag not well tested.)

POS_2_7_0 *** THIS TAG WAS DONE WRONG PLEASE NEVER USE ***
          Same as 2_6_7 + FEDInterface changes to support 
          FEB 12 firmeware version. (Tag not well tested.)

POS_2_6_7 New code for the Vsf calibration for linearity. Calibation
          to check FED-AOH mapping. Calibration now run on a workloop.
          Supervisor now can auto update. (Tag not well tested.)

POS_2_6_6 Fix to mode register in the ROC UB calibration. 
          This tag was done incorrectly. To make it work:
          Get CVS revision 1.20 of
          PixelFEDROCUBEqualizationCalibration.cc
          and then change the mode register from
          0x8 to 0x0 by hand. 

POS_2_6_5 Implement new algorithm for finding the FED phase.

POS_2_6_4 Minor bug fixes.

POS_2_6_3 Bug fix to HAL address map for PixelFECInterface. Substantial
          rewrite of AOH_BIAS, ROCUB, and TBMUB calibrations.
          First version of Vsf and VhldDel calibrations.

POS_2_6_2 More modifications to calibration code; now execute()
          method returns a bool and execution of algorithm continues
          as long as true is returned. Moved more functionality
          into PixelCalibrationBase. Updated to a more complete
          Iana vs Vana calibration. Added PixelLowVoltageMap class
          to map the data point names to the modules. 

POS_2_6_1 Fix from will to stale event problem in FIFO1 transp.
          data mode. Now make sure that baseline calibration does
          not change baseline and channel 'enbable' bits when
          it writes out the new params_fed.dat files. Includes 
          code in PixelCalibConfiguration to implement 3 different
          modes for the mask bits during calibration. See UsersGuide.

POS_2_6_0 This tag is very similar to 2_5_1 except that it uses
          the Dec 4(5) 2007 FED firmware that uses a 961 words
          FIFO1 transparent buffer. There is still an issue with
          a few calibrations for how to handle 'double' trigger
          readout of the transparent data.

POS_2_5_1 Allows running code with a subset of the detector in the
          detector configuration. Also supports new format of the
          PixelDetectorConfig where rocs are listed and including a
          status. Includes prototype for a Iana vs. Vana calibration
          and a PixelAlive/SCurve/GainCalibration algorithm that
          uses the SLink and not VME readout. Buffered FEC mode
          on by default in calibrations; need V16 pFEC firmware.

POS_2_5_0 Starting with this tag the fed_id in the params_fed_N.dat
          file has to match the file name i.e. id=N.
