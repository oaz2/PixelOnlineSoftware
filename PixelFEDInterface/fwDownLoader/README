gmake                 makes a static library
gmake Set=fed_jam1    makes executable fed_jam1.exe in bin/... directory

As returned by the program:
Usage: fedjam1 <ACTION> <BASEADDRESS> <FPGA GROUP> <FILENAME> 

(you probably need to use fed_jam1.exe in place of fedjam1)
    <ACTION> may be PROGRAM or VERIFY
    <BASEADDRESS> should be hex e.g. 0x1C000000
    <FPGA GROUP> should be FRONT or CENTER

for example, I think it will work like this with the CMS build stuff

prompt> fed_jam1.exe VERIFY 0x1C000000 CENTER center.jbc

Hopefully I can update this after it is working!

If you are the first person to use this code on your machine, you may
need to fine tune a parameter if your CPU is fast-ish. Depending on
your patience, you can increase: (in test/fed_jam1.cpp)
one_ms_delay = 50000L; 
to 
one_ms_delay = 500000L; 
etc. Until things work for you.
